<p>By Catherine Bennett, Global Communications Manager</p><p>When Kati Gammals was a single mother she was discussing with her friends the qualities of an ideal husband. During this conversation one person chimed in saying how nice it would be marrying a millionaire. Kati thought about how much more rewarding it would be to find someone she could make millions with.</p><p>Eric and Kati Gammals met in the network marketing industry in 2004 and were married 3.5 months after their first introduction. Since starting their Synergy business in 2011, Eric and Kati have been unstoppable, and have become the ultimate business partners that thousands aspire to emulate.</p><p>Less than four years after working steadily with Synergy WorldWide, Eric and Kati were inducted into the Million Dollar Club. This achievement has increased excitement throughout Europe and especially within the group of people who made their successful start possible.</p><p>“First and foremost, we want to thank Synergy’s founder Dan Higginson and everyone in the Synergy family,” Eric said. “We feel very privileged to be part of this company. We would not be here without our leaders and the team. We are lucky to have so great people around us. When we were rewarded with the Million Dollar Club membership at the 2015 Kickoff event, the Team Members where surprised that it came to reality so fast. They were so proud and their eyes were opened to what is possible for them. It made this business opportunity even more real.”</p><p>Reaching this level of success has always been a dream for Eric and Kati. They also know that if you want to achieve something, dreaming is not enough. They have been working with determination for many years to attain the Million Dollar Club achievement, and with Synergy, their list of goals has come to full fruition. Now that they’ve reached their financial freedom, they’ve set their goals even higher while working with people who are willing to do the same.</p><p>Before finding network marketing, Eric worked a full-time job in the electronics industry. He lived his life from paycheck to paycheck and began accumulating debt until he decided to take responsibility for his life. Soon after his decision to take control of his life, he discovered network marketing.</p><p>Even though Eric’s first years in multi-level marketing were not easy, Eric decided that failure was not an option. He started to learn the tricks and trades of networking marketing’s most successful leaders. Every day he challenged his comfort zone and faced his fears. Kati was busy working her own business at that time, but supported Eric on her days off.</p><p>“The dictionary is the only place where success comes before work,” Eric said. “In this industry you have to work on both mental and physical levels, but I realised there was one thing holding us back—we both had negative views about money.”</p><p>Eric traveled to the U.S. to attend a training session where he learned that you cannot become a millionaire without changing your mindset and your attitude. Eric wanted to share this experience with Kati and he took her to the same training.</p><p>“That weekend was a turning point in my life,” Kati said. “I learned that to earn more, you have to become more. During one of the training sessions, we wrote down how much residual income we wanted to earn each month. I remember writing down 10,000 euro per month. Then the presenter asked us to multiply that number by 10. I still remember how uncomfortable that felt for me. ! I was raised to think that having all of that money would be selfish, but I decided to change my thinking. I’ve always been interested in helping people and making the world a better place. I realised the more money I had, the more I could give.”</p><p>“We love the idea that in Synergy your earnings are related to the amount of people you’ve touched. The more you earn, the more people you have helped,” Eric said.</p><p>While Eric and Kati are thrilled to be members of the Million Dollar Club, network marketing isn’t all about the money for them. It’s about fulfillment. It’s about charity. It’s about having a purpose and becoming a better human being. This membership signifies that Eric and Kati have made great achievements in each of these areas. And this influential couple doesn’t plan on slowing down any time soon. Both Eric and Kati said they have been forever changed by their relationship with Synergy WorldWide.</p><p>“We love Synergy WorldWide because hearts are at the focus of the business,” Eric said. “This is about personal growth, not selling. The most important thing is to not give up when you are faced with hard times. The bigger your goals, the bigger your challenges will be. We would not be here if we had quit when we had challenges. When you travel a long way and nobody’s there, your patience is measured. I’ve learned that you can turn every challenging situation into an advantage and that’s a real gift. Learn to enjoy the ride and have fun. Stay humble. Be grateful. Remember why you’re in this business and always look back to this thought.” </p><p><a href="http://synergyworldwide.com/sites/legacymag/eu/0315/en/Gammals-MillionDollarClub.html"></a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Finland Power Couple Hits One Million Dollar Milestone</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
