Synergy's Legacy Retreat is taking qualifiers to a small, seaside country with big personality---a unique destination Synergy has never been before: Monaco!

We hope you are able to join us May 16-20, 2017, in this melting pot of European culture. Drawing off of Spanish, French and Italian heritage, Monaco has a rich history with something for everyone to enjoy---sightseeing, gambling, museums, gardens, and beaches.

Qualified Team Members will be immersed in the fairytale glamour of Monaco's Hotel Hermitage. This extravagant hotel offers an elegance and charm fit for royalty, and is the perfect place to pamper Synergy's elite Team Members.

Commit now to qualify for this event. It will be unlike any Legacy Retreat Synergy has hosted before. The qualification period is January 1 to December 31, 2016\. Click the link below to learn how to qualify.
